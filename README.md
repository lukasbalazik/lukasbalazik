### About me 
:japanese_ogre: Interested in cyber security research and learning new things  
:blue_heart: From Blue Team activities im interested in data analysis, malware analysis, forensics and linux hardening  
:heart: From Red Team activities im interested in penetration testing and malware creation (for CTF or for better understanding at malware analysis)  
:sparkles: My goal is to fully understand system i use (hopefuly on the lowest level possible), making things fast as possible and memory efficient. Also i want to give back to the community what i took from it (in form of open source and advising people about cybersec)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning LKM rootkits and how to abuse kernel
